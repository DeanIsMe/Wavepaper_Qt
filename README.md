# Wavepaper (C++, Qt)

![Wavepaper demo](/Resources/demo.gif)  

Wave physics based abstract art generator.  

This is a C++ version of Wavepaper, with a Qt interface. 

Download and run the program from the GitHub Releases.

The original Wavepaper was created in MATLAB, and that version is much more mature. [See the MATLAB repo](https://github.com/DeanIsMe/Wavepaper_Release) for a description of the project.  

The purpose of this C++/Qt version was to allow the program to be easily run without any installation. It also has a much more efficient image generation engine which allows for live previews as the user drags the mouse and sliders.  

However, the user interface in this version is very rudimentary and it's missing features compared to the MATLAB version.
